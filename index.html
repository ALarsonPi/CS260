	<H2>About Me</H2>

	<H2>Work Experience</H2>
	<p>Somehow I've been lucky enough to work a lot with computers. During high school I worked as a computer repairman fixing old computers with new parts at a company called "Reynalds and Reynalds".</p>
	<p>After my mission, I came right out here to Utah and ended up working 2 jobs here. I work on campus in the CSC in the team prepping veggies to be shipped around campus. Additionally, I work for a company in Washington writing an app for them. They have a website that they want turned into app form, so I was hired to learn how to make an app, and then make that app for them. I've been incredibly lucky to be able to have employment and learn a lot from every job I've had so far. </p>
